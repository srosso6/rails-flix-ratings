#Flix Ratings

This app allows users to search for films and vote for their top 3 films in each decade. It displays the top 3 films as voted by all users, taking into account the imdb and rotten tomato ratings.

It is a full-stack app created in Rails using a PostgreSQL database and Bootstrap for the styling. The film information is retrieved from The Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.
