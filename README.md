#Flix Ratings

This app allows users to search for films and vote for their top 3 films in each decade. It displays the top 3 films as voted by all users, taking into account the imdb and rotten tomato ratings.

It is a full-stack app created in Rails using a PostgreSQL database and Bootstrap for the styling. The film information is retrieved from The Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.


If you would like to view this app in the browser, please seed the database first for a better experience.
